    "# RemBG — Naive Video Background Removal Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook demonstrates\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook removes the background from every frame of a video using **rembg**, a library built on top of neural segmentation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How background removal works\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional background removal (like green screens) relies on a known, uniform colour.  \n",
    "AI-based removal works differently: a neural network looks at the whole image and predicts which pixels belong to the *foreground subject* (a person, object, etc.) and which belong to the *background*. This is called **salient object detection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default model used here is **U2Net** (Qin et al., 2020). It was trained on large datasets of images with annotated foregrounds and learns to produce a soft *alpha mask* — a grayscale image where white = keep and black = remove. The mask is then applied to the original frame to produce a transparent PNG.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why \"naive\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each frame is processed **independently** — the model has no memory of the previous frame. This means that even tiny differences in lighting or subject position cause the mask to shift slightly between frames, producing visible **flickering or jitter** in the output video.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an intentional limitation of this demonstrator. Fixing it requires **temporal consistency** techniques (e.g. optical flow, cross-frame attention) explored in other notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps in this notebook:**\n",
    "1. Install dependencies\n",
    "2. Create working folders\n",
    "3. Upload a video\n",
    "4. Extract frames with FFmpeg\n",
    "5. Apply RemBG to each frame individually\n",
    "6. Reassemble frames into a video\n",
    "7. Observe the flickering artefact"
